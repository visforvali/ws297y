# Low-Stakes Writing
{: .no_toc }

These low-stakes writing prompts put *you* in the driver's seat.

Instead of asking you a narrow question that might feel "leading" or like it's "testing" your understanding or knowledge, these prompts provide frameworks to anchor you in course content and ask *you* to ask and attempt to answer a question, within a loose framework designed to keep you anchored in course content. This gets you to develop your learning out of things that naturally excite, inspire, and/or confuse you most.

The questions you come up with in your low-stakes posts will be integrated into class lectures and discussions, so this also helps you feel more confident about vocally contributing to class, i.e. you can talk about your own question and someone else's!

{: .warning }
> You can ask and answer any question you like, but it *must* be informed by the prompt framework you selected for the week and pertain to that week's readings. 

Each week, you'll be given 3 prompts and asked to use 1 of them to write-to-think towards asking and answering a question. These posts won't be perfect &mdash; as a matter of fact, they shouldn't be. I hope for low-stakes posts that are informal, casual, unrehearsed, definitely unpolished, more concerned with precision of thought than adherence to grammar, mechanics, and academic style. 

All prompts and their instructions are listed here. They offer various ideas, craft techniques, activities, and themes to prompt your questing. 

{: .important }
> Since low-stakes posts will help launch class discussions, please post them directly in #classroom (and feel free to react/reply to your comrades' posts!). Include "✍️" and the title of the prompt you're responding to at the start of your post, so I know it's your submission for the week and have context for your response. **Draft your posts in a word processor, so you have a local saved copy in case of technical difficulties.**

> ✍️ **Poetic Inference**: In Atwood's "The Page," the lines "The page is not a pool but a skin, a skin is there to hold in and it can feel you touching it. Did you really think it would just lie there and do nothing?" felt like a revelation. I think I always knew this but didn't have the words, so it resonated when she first called it "a skin." Between sentences, I think the switch from a sort of matter-of-fact description (the *is* is doing a lot of work) to an accusatory question is meant to be quick and disorienting and make readers feel (infer?) the risk of reading and writing, which mostly is treated like a safe, boring activity. The page is a skin which means it's also a thing with skin, full of organs like a living body, and the same way skin touches you back when you touch it, the page acts on you when you read it or write on it. There's maybe a kind of feminist nod to the violation of gender and sexual norms with "lie there and do nothing" &mdash; the (female/gender nonconforming) body is not a passive thing for you to impose meaning onto. Are we supposed to think that the page = bodies that resist easy understanding? And if so, are we supposed to think that inference is more dangerous for readers who approach the page like its passive, or for readers who approach the page expecting a confrontation? Or, thinking of social justice now, should the page *always* be a confrontation?

## Annotation

Skim the reading again. As soon as you encounter a word, phrase, or sentence that catches
your attention, immediately annotate it with a guess as to why it struck you. Use these annotations to guide you in formulating a question you have about the relationship between the text's form, the reader, and its social justice argument. Attach a photograph of one of your annotated pages with your response as well. 

## Copycat

Locate an excerpt you either loved or hated, and use the same style to formulate a question about the form/content relationship in the text. Write your question in the same style. Pay attention to the readerly/writerly mindset that this use of mimicry puts you in, or removes you from, and use this to help you answer the question you just posed.

## I Hope This Email Finds You

SUBJ: Re: Your question about how genre/audience are used for social justice
MSG: Formulate a question that deliberately misunderstands the aims of this text, then pretend you're writing a 3-5 paragraph email explaining the the text's genre/audience and social justice message in response to someone who has asked you this question. 

## Just Curious

Formulate a "starter" question about something in the text that you're curious about &mdash; a sentence, a word, a metaphor, a title, a plot point, a characterization moment &mdash; and its relationship with social justice. Ask another question that gets you closer to an answer. Keep going until you come up with a question that feels like you've stumbled upon a question that grabs you, even if it's far from the original question. In answering *this* question, reflect on how pursuing readerly curiosity about this part of the text might develop a specific aspect of social justice consciousness.

## Keyholes

A keyhole offers a partial glimpse of a locked room &mdash; possibly, a forbidden room. Identify a passage that 


## Loved Lines



## Poetic Inference

Identify 2-5 lines (they don't have to be consecutive) that made you feel like your senses came alive. Try to figure out what's going on in and between sentences that inspired and anchored your interpretation. Use this process to guide you in formulating a question you have about the text's poetics and reliance on reader inference to get at the aims of social justice.

## Stumbling Blocks

Identify a place where you felt confusion, and then identify the place where (if) you found your footing again. Reflect on how being confused by that part of the text specifically might help enact the social justice argument(s) of the piece as a whole. Try to interpret both the part of the text that confused you and the part of the text that clarified things for you. 

## Truth to Power

Choose a minor character &mdash; a character who isn't the protagonist and whose interiority we aren't given &mdash; and use their perspective to speak truth to power, attempting to fill a gap that the protagonist ignores or doesn't successfully address. You can use first-person ("I"), second-person ("you"), or third-person ("name/pronoun"); select the perspective you think will best accomplish this, and briefly note why.

## Why



# High-Stakes Writing

For your high-stakes project, you'll choose one social justice issue. The project has two parts: 

- A compilation of theoretical fiction (theory, fiction, and theory-fiction) revolving around the social justice issue 
- 



 revolving around a social justice issue of your choosing. These pieces should emulate the craft techniques we discuss
