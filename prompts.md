# Overview

The low-stakes writing prompts for this class get you to engage with the readings by having you pose the question &mdash; allowing you to respond to things that excite, inspire, and/or confuse you most in the texts &mdash; and begin to figure out an answer in writing in aadvance of class discussion. 

{: .warning }

   you with a theme to help you focus  you'll use to formulate your own question

# Annotation

Skim the reading again. As soon as you encounter a word, phrase, or sentence that catches
your attention, immediately annotate it with a guess as to why it struck you. Use these annotations to guide you in formulating a question you have about the relationship between the text's form, the reader, and its social justice argument. Attach a photograph of one of your annotated pages with your response as well.

# Poetic Inference

Identify 2-3 paragraphs (they don't have to be consecutive) that made you feel like your senses came alive. Try to figure out what's going on between sentences that furthered your interpretive processes. Use this process to guide you in formulating a question you have about the text's poetics and reliance on reader inference to get at the aims of social justice message.

# Copycat

Locate an excerpt you either loved or hated, and use the same style to formulate a question about the form/content relationship in the text. Write your question in the same style. Pay attention to the readerly/writerly mindset that this use of mimicry puts you in, or removes you from, and use this to help you answer the question you just posed.

## I Hope This Email Finds You

SUBJ: Re: Your question about how genre/audience are used for social justice
MSG: Pretend you're writing a 3-5 paragraph email to a fictional boss, in which you reply to a question you formulate about the relationship between the text's genre/audience and its social justice message as though your fictional boss asked you the question. You can imagine that your boss' first email was either deliberately obtuse or earnestly inquiring.
