# Overview

The low-stakes writing prompts for this class get you to engage with the readings by having you pose the question &mdash; allowing you to respond to things that excite, inspire, and/or confuse you most in the texts &mdash; and begin to figure out an answer in writing in aadvance of class discussion. 

{: .warning }
> You can ask and answer any question you like, but it *must* be informed by the prompt framework you selected for the week and pertain to that week's readings. 

Each week, 3 prompts are identified and linked on the calendar. All prompts and their instructions are listed here. 

The prompts below concern various ideas, craft techniques, activities, and themes. You'll use these prompts to help you come up with a question about the week's readings for your low-stakes writing post and to help you prepare for class discussion. 

# Annotation

Skim the reading again. As soon as you encounter a word, phrase, or sentence that catches
your attention, immediately annotate it with a guess as to why it struck you. Use these annotations to guide you in formulating a question you have about the relationship between the text's form, the reader, and its social justice argument. Attach a photograph of one of your annotated pages with your response as well.

# Poetic Inference

Identify 2-3 paragraphs (they don't have to be consecutive) that made you feel like your senses came alive. Try to figure out what's going on between sentences that furthered your interpretive processes. Use this process to guide you in formulating a question you have about the text's poetics and reliance on reader inference to get at the aims of social justice message.

# Copycat

Locate an excerpt you either loved or hated, and use the same style to formulate a question about the form/content relationship in the text. Write your question in the same style. Pay attention to the readerly/writerly mindset that this use of mimicry puts you in, or removes you from, and use this to help you answer the question you just posed.

## I Hope This Email Finds You

SUBJ: Re: Your question about how genre/audience are used for social justice
MSG: Pretend you're writing a 3-5 paragraph email to a fictional boss, in which you reply to a question you formulate about the relationship between the text's genre/audience and its social justice message as though your fictional boss asked you the question. You can imagine that your boss' first email was either deliberately obtuse or earnestly inquiring.

## Just Curious

Formulate a "starter" question about something in the text that you're curious about &mdash; a sentence, a word, a metaphor, a title, a plot point, a characterization moment &mdash; and its relationship with social justice. Ask another question that gets you closer to an answer. Keep going until you come up with a question that feels like you've stumbled upon a question that grabs you, even if it's far from the original question. 

In answering *this* question, reflect on the role your curiosity as a reader just played in
