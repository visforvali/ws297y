# Course Description 🧐

This course focuses on genres of resistance &mdash; particularly the lyric essay &mdash; and what it means to write for social justice. Part-webinar, part-roleplay, part-workshop, you'll be introduced to the elements of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction through reading, writing, and individual and cooperative play. Since social justice writing is writing that _does_ something to its audience, you'll regularly engage with, interpret (and create!) texts that model how content and form act together on readers. In doing so, you'll consider questions like: 

- How have we been shaped, personally and politically, by reading and writing? 
- How have systems of power and oppression shaped who and how we read; who and what we write about; how we compose and perceive our compositions; and which genres we consider "legitimate" genres?
- What potential impact can we &mdash; through what we write &mdash; have on our communities and institutions? 

# Learning Outcomes ✅

The idea that anyone masters anything in a semester is a myth. But you'll leave the class with at least a sense of:

- Existing arguments about the relationship between writing and social justice
- The role of the relationship between form and content in writing for social justice
- How intersectional feminist, queer, trans, and/or crip modes of writing operate
- What might belong in a literary canon of resistance
- How to write for social justice yourself

# Required Materials 💰

{ .note }
> All required readings are provided for free. They're uploaded to [Classes\Content](#){:target="_blank"} and are linked on this website: by week on the [Calendar](/calendar.md) and by alphabetical order in [Resources](/resources.md).

On your own, you'll need to obtain:

- A marble composition notebook for journaling by hand (if you're disabled and require assistive technology to write, please contact me).
- A short prose book (>50 pages) of your choosing that you wouldn't mind parting with. It can be fiction, nonfiction, a book you already own, or a book bought for this purpose, but it must be a book you're willing to destroy.

# Technology/Platforms 🌐

This is an **online synchronous course that meets twice a week using Discord** for sync sessions and sync/async text chats. Outside of class, you'll read, write, and prepare for our sync class sessions, during which I'll facilitate discussion, answer and float questions, and help you interactively generate prompts and ideas for your writing.

**The server invite link is on Classes\Content\Syllabus**. If you're new to Discord, check out our [Quickstart Guide](/discord.md) or the [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord){:target="_blank"} to get started and reach out if you need help!

We'll use 2 platforms (plus occasional use of Classes) this semester. Here's what they're used for:

- **Discord**: Discussion forum for class meetings, text chats, communication, announcements, c
- **Course Website**: This site, where course content is posted.
- **Classes**: Platform for submitting assignments and viewing grades. You should be automatically added to Classes.

{: .important }
> We won't use Classes *except* for me to do enrollment verification, collect your major project submissions, and submit your grades.

# This Class &: Accessibility and Student Support ♿

I want you to succeed! If something might affect or is affecting your academic performance, **please talk to me ASAP** so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. You don't need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether it's because of disability, mental health challenges, work, family, stress, etc., and you don't need to disclose personal info, either.

## Pace &: Student Accessibility Services

To request an accommodation for a qualifying disability a student must self-identify and register with the [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services){:target="_blank"} for his/her/their campus. Student Accessibility Services for the New York City campus may be contacted at (212) 346-1199 or 161 William St, 10th Floor. Student Accessibility Services for the Westchester campuses may be contacted at (914) 773-3201 or the Administration Center, 861 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. 


## Participation Scores

{: .important }
> If you select the "Check in Weekly" role on Discord in #get-roles, I'll encourage you to participate each week by DMing you every Monday with basic questions about how you're doing, if you're confused about the materials, and if you'd like to chat sometime. If you need help surmounting any anxiety about reaching out to your professors, choose this role, and reply to me when I reach out to you to get the conversation going!

You're expected to regularly, substantively participate through thoughtful, informal contributions in text channels and sync class sessions that reflect what we're learning organically reacting/replying to classmates; doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion; and attending coffee chats.

Participation takes a lot of forms! It means talking out loud, posting in #classroom and in #team, submitting writing activities in a timely fashion, reading together and "buddy-working" with peers. It means organically replying and reacting to your classmates' posts (no boring "discussion board"-style replies, please!), coming to coffee chats, helping your peers, etc. It means DMing me for clarification, or before an absence or a class you know will be an "off day" to ask me to say something in class for you. These are all measurable, valid forms of participation! If there's another form that works for you, or if you're anxious about how you’re participating, please proactively reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we'll need to meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw.

# Assignments 📚

You'll do high-stakes (major, graded) and low-stakes (minor, ungraded) writing in this class.

### Low-Stakes (Ungraded) Writing

You'll briefly organize your thoughts in writing in threads on on Discord once or twice a week (check the Calendar for due dates) to synthesize your experience of reading texts and engaging in interactive fiction into writing that opens up new futurities. I try to open these threads in advance and leave them unlocked so you can post, reply, and reference at any time.

{: .important }
> Low-stakes writing is scored on the basis of completion (provided they demonstrate thought and care). Note that I'm unable to read late submissions except when warranted by extenuating circumstances or unless alternate deadlines were arranged in advance.

Each week, you'll either choose 1 of the writing prompts listed for that week, then follow the instructions for that prompt as given on the [Writing Prompts](/prompts.md) page. 

### High-Stakes (Graded) Writing

Over the course of the semester, you'll compose an anthology of rough drafts and false starts that borrow from the craft techniques of the assigned readings and that are generated through the interactive fiction and single-player journaling games we'll play together as a class or in teams for this purpose. A lot of this work will be drafted and commented on when we play together and when you submit low-stakes writing activities. Later in the semester, you'll submit an ungraded draft of this anthology and revise it using feedback from your teammates and me. 

{: .warning }
> For course policies, such as a description of the alt-grading system, attendance policy, disability accommodations, GenAI and academic integrity, and other information, check out [Course Policies](/policies.md).





# Writing-Enhanced Course (WEC)

This class is writing-enhanced, so writing and revision are central to learning content and achieving course goals. You'll receive detailed written handouts for each writing assignment, specifying grading criteria and clearly setting forth expectations. Writing will be thought of as a process whereby you generate ideas, receive feedback, and then revise. You'll practice their writing through a combination of low stakes, informal writing and more formal assignments. You'll receive instructor-generated feedback for revision on at least one writing assignment prior to a second submission and subsequent grading. Final drafts will be evaluated based on evaluative criteria from a checklist or rubric.

# Antiracism Education (ARE)

This class is an antiracism education course and fulfills the ARE requirement, so diversity, equity, race, and ethnicity are central to learning content and achieving course goals. In the context of our course content, you'll learn about commitments to eliminate racism, receive exposure to a variety of perspectives, and acquire an antiracist toolkit that you can use in future classes or workplaces or for social justice causes. Antiracism education is considered necessary for career readiness, so this class will also help you prepare for your future world of work.


# Pace &: Academic Integrity Code 🧠

{ .important }
> In accordance with university policy, all violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee. 

You're responsible for following Pace's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/pace-university-academic-integrity-code.pdf){:target="_blank"}. In short: Do your own work, and don't use AI. If you use sources, including the assigned texts, cite them whether you're paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text's words). Don't invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, or pass off another human's or GenAI model's responses as your own. 

Low-stakes writing assignments can be &mdash; are meant to be, even! &mdash; repurposed in your essay drafts, but you can't reuse the same pieces of writing across multiple assignments (unless the assignment asks you to cumulatively build on them). 

## This Class &: Writing with(out) GenAI 🤖

{: .warning }
> The use of GenAI for *any* purpose isn't permitted in this class. If you take that risk, you're responsible for necessary fact-checking, rewriting to fit the assignment's rhetorical context and genre, and providing attribution for all the sources GenAI is using. For reasons of copyright infringement, you may not upload material from this class (my materials or your peers' submissions) to GenAI models.

Writing is thinking. Therefore, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies have no place at any stage of the writing process. Writing is painstaking work we do to refine our ideas and communicate them to others. LLMs are designed to produce plausible sounding permutations of text, with no ideas or thought behind them. They violate academic integrity. They encourage delusion. They destroy the environment. They do all this to produce synthetic, mediocre text in the name of capitalistic imperatives. They reduce your capacity for thought, across human activity. They reduce human intentionality.
