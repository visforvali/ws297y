# Course Description 🧐

This course focuses on genres of resistance &mdash; particularly the lyric essay &mdash; and what it means to write for social justice. Part-webinar, part-roleplay, part-workshop, you'll be introduced to the elements of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction through reading, writing, and individual and cooperative play. Since social justice writing is writing that _does_ something to its audience, you'll regularly engage with, interpret (and create!) texts that model how content and form act together on readers. In doing so, you'll consider questions like: 

- How have we been shaped, personally and politically, by reading and writing? 
- How have systems of power and oppression shaped who and how we read; who and what we write about; how we compose and perceive our compositions; and which genres we consider "legitimate" genres?
- What potential impact can we &mdash; through what we write &mdash; have on our communities and institutions? 

# Learning Outcomes ✅

The idea that anyone masters anything in a semester is a myth. But you'll leave the class with at least a sense of:

- Existing arguments about the relationship between writing and social justice
- The role of the relationship between form and content in writing for social justice
- How intersectional feminist, queer, trans, and/or crip modes of writing operate
- What might belong in a literary canon of resistance
- How to write for social justice yourself

# Required Materials 💰

{ .note }
> All required readings are provided for free. They're uploaded to [Classes\Content](#){:target="_blank"} and are linked on this website: by week on the [Calendar](/calendar.md) and by alphabetical order in [Resources](/resources.md).

On your own, you'll need to obtain:

- A marble composition notebook for journaling by hand (if you're disabled and require assistive technology to write, please contact me).
- A short prose book (>50 pages) of your choosing that you wouldn't mind parting with. It can be fiction, nonfiction, a book you already own, or a book bought for this purpose, but it must be a book you're willing to destroy.

# Technology/Platforms 🌐

This is an **online synchronous course that meets twice a week using Discord** for sync sessions and sync/async text chats. Outside of class, you'll read, write, and prepare for our sync class sessions, during which I'll facilitate discussion, answer and float questions, and help you interactively generate prompts and ideas for your writing.

**The server invite link is on Classes\Content\Syllabus**. If you're new to Discord, check out our [Quickstart Guide](/discord.md) or the [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord){:target="_blank"} to get started and reach out if you need help!

{: .important }
> We won't use Classes *except* for me to do enrollment verification, collect your high-stakes writing, and share your grades with you.

We'll use 2 platforms (plus occasional use of Classes) this semester:

- **Discord**: Discussion forum for class meetings, text chats, communication, announcements, c
- **Course Website**: This site, where course content is posted.
- **Classes**: Platform for submitting assignments and viewing grades. You should be automatically added to Classes.

# Policies for WS 297Y & Pace
{: .important }
> Make sure to read the policies specific to this course! You've probably read Pace's policies a thousand times, but they're provided here again in case you ever need the info. I've labeled them "WS 297Y" and "Pace" to differentiate in case you want to skim/skip Pace's boilerplate stuff.

## WS 297Y: Accessibility & Student Support ♿

{: .warning }
> If something might affect or is affecting your academic performance, **please talk to me ASAP** so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. 

{: .note }
> If you select the "Check in Weekly" role on Discord in #get-roles, I'll encourage you to participate each week by DMing you every Monday with basic questions about how you're doing, if you're confused about the materials, and if you'd like to chat sometime. If you need help surmounting any anxiety about reaching out to your professors, choose this role, and reply to me when I reach out to you to get the conversation going!

I want you to succeed! If you're dealing with issues or a schedule that will affect your performance, please proactively talk to me. You don't need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether it's because of disability, mental health challenges, work, family, stress, etc., and you don't need to disclose personal info, either. Barring emergencies, I need as much advance notice as possible to effectively accommodate you. You don’t need to disclose any more details than you wish. You can just tell me you’re dealing with stuff, and then we can strategize ways for you to fulfill the course requirements while taking care of yourself. 

To request an official accommodation for a qualifying disability a student must self-identify and register with the [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services){:target="_blank"} for his/her/their campus. Student Accessibility Services for the New York City campus may be contacted at (212) 346-1199 or 161 William St, 10th Floor. Student Accessibility Services for the Westchester campuses may be contacted at (914) 773-3201 or the Administration Center, 861 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. 

# WS 297Y: Attendance Policy 🙋

{ .warning }
> In this class, attendance doesn't mean showing up and passively existing. You have to actively participate to be counted as present. If a ballpark number helps, aim for 2-3 contributions during each sync session; in weeks when you're quieter in class, or if you're looking to boost your overall participation, aim for 2-3 substantive text chats outside of class (in addition to homework posts).

{ .important }
> The pandemic isn't over. For information on how to affordably protect yourself from infectious diseases, refer to this informational resource I put together on [pandemics and public health](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/pandemics-public-health/){:target="_blank"}, which includes info on current strains, long-term costs of COVID-19 and post-COVID syndromes, where to buy PPE affordably, and an abbreviated course policy on illness.

Life is stressful: We're dealing with changes in government and social policy &mdash; cuts to open education, equity initiatives that support women, BIPOC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ folks, social welfare, FEMA, the VA; bans on public health and science communications; attacks on citizenship and ICE raids &mdash; and ongoing problems like the rising cost of living; weather extremes and environmental disasters; gun violence; GenAI's destruction of environment, human intentionality, and reliable information; food recalls; medication shortages; and an uptick in anti-intellectualism and bigotry. 

Naturally, all this can impact your class performance, gradually or suddenly. Your participation might also falter due to sickness, religious holidays, and/or Pace-affiliated extracurricular activities. At the same time, because much of our knowledge-making happens during class sessions, your attendance is critical to your success. 

Since a large part of your course grade comes from consistent, active participation, the more you post, react, and chat with each other in and out of class, the better &mdash; and since actively participating is how learning happens, it'll help you do better on assignments, too! If you miss a class, you're responsible for reaching out to me in a timely fashion to arrange alternate deadlines and make sure you're on the right track, and for submitting any written assignments, reviewing the week's materials, and asking for notes or help on Discord. 

If you get sick or experience some other health challenge, communicate with me early so we can make a plan to make a plan when you're better. We'll get you caught up when you're well enough to resume participating. As a high-risk disabled individual myself, if I become sick, especially with COVID-19 or another serious illness, I'll need to aggressively rest. You'll have the materials and each other on Discord to help you continue with your learning. I'll rejoin when I'm well enough.

{: .note }
> I don't want any of us risking our well-being for this class, but I can only overextend myself so much &mdash; meaning I can't give unlimited extensions if everyone keeps getting sick. The more you reduce your risk of getting sick, the more likely we are to finish the course without significant interruptions to course continuity and your learning. 

Remember, communal care, mutual aid, and compassion will get us through!

## Pace: Writing-Enhanced Course (WEC)

This class is writing-enhanced, so writing and revision are central to learning content and achieving course goals. You'll receive detailed written handouts for each writing assignment, specifying grading criteria and clearly setting forth expectations. Writing will be thought of as a process whereby you generate ideas, receive feedback, and then revise. You'll practice their writing through a combination of low stakes, informal writing and more formal assignments. You'll receive instructor-generated feedback for revision on at least one writing assignment prior to a second submission and subsequent grading. Final drafts will be evaluated based on evaluative criteria from a checklist or rubric.

## Pace: Antiracism Education (ARE)

This class is an antiracism education course and fulfills the ARE requirement, so diversity, equity, race, and ethnicity are central to learning content and achieving course goals. In the context of our course content, you'll learn about commitments to eliminate racism, receive exposure to a variety of perspectives, and acquire an antiracist toolkit that you can use in future classes or workplaces or for social justice causes. Antiracism education is considered necessary for career readiness, so this class will also help you prepare for your future world of work.

## WS 297Y: Academic Integrity & Brain-Only Writing 🧠

{: .warning }
> You're responsible for following Pace's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/pace-university-academic-integrity-code.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Don't invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, pass off another human's responses as your own, or use GenAI. In accordance with university policy, all violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee. 

Writing *is* the process of thinking and learning, so do your own work! If you use sources, including the assigned texts, cite them whether you're paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text's words). If a submission sounds "off" for any reason, and if you're unable to walk me through the writing choices you made and why (what you hoped to accomplish, how your thoughts and wordsmithing were supposed to get you there), then I'm unlikely to accept that submission for credit.

And because writing is thinking, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies &mdash; which are accelerated text prediction machines designed for engagement, not learning &mdash; have no place at any stage of the writing process. Writing is painstaking work we do to refine our ideas and communicate them to others. LLMs are designed to produce plausible sounding permutations of text, with no ideas or thought behind them. They violate academic integrity. They encourage delusion. They destroy the environment. They do all this to produce synthetic, mediocre text in the name of capitalistic imperatives. They reduce your capacity for thought, across human activity. They reduce human intentionality. 

{: .warning }
> The use of GenAI for *any* purpose isn't permitted in this class. For reasons of copyright infringement, you may not upload material from this class (my materials or your peers' submissions) to GenAI models.

If you choose to risk using an LLM in this class, you need to effectively fact-check, rewrite to fit the assignment's rhetorical context and genre, provide attribution for all the sources GenAI is using, and be prepared to explain your craft choices in terms of the writing ecology they belong to.

Read the rest of the [Writing without AI](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/writing-without-ai/){:target="_blank"} policy and philosophy here. And remember: GenAI/LLM use might be trendy but isn't inevitable. You do harm to yourself and to the aims of social justice by using it. If you've been using it, use this course to experiment with getting back to brain-only writing.
