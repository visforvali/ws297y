> I respond to async messages — messages in Discord's text channels, direct messages (DMs) on Discord, and Pace emails — within 48 hrs during the week. Anything I get over the weekend, I'll respond to on Mon (I *might* reply sooner, but don't count on it).

# Course Description 🧐

This course focuses on genres of resistance — particularly the lyric essay — and what it means to write for social justice. Part-webinar, part-roleplay, part-workshop, you'll be introduced to the elements of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction through reading, writing, and individual and cooperative play. Since social justice writing is writing that _does_ something to its audience, you'll regularly engage with, interpret (and create!) texts that model how content and form act together on readers. In doing so, you'll consider questions like: 

- How have we been shaped, personally and politically, by reading and writing? 
- How have systems of power and oppression shaped who and how we read; who and what we write about; how we compose and perceive our compositions; and which genres we consider "legitimate" genres?
- What potential impact can we—through what we write—have on our communities and institutions?

# Learning Outcomes ✅

The idea that anyone masters anything in a semester is a myth. But you'll leave the class with at least a sense of:

- Existing arguments about the relationship between writing and social justice
- The role of the relationship between form and content in writing for social justice
- How intersectional feminist, queer, trans, and/or crip modes of writing operate
- What might belong in a literary canon of resistance
- How to write for social justice yourself

# Course Structure 🍎

This is an **online synchronous course that meets twice a week using Discord** for sync sessions and sync/async text chats. Outside of class, you'll read, write, and prepare for our sync class sessions, during which I'll facilitate discussion, answer and float questions, and help you interactively generate prompts and ideas for your writing.

**The server invite link is on Classes\Content\Syllabus**. If you're new to Discord, check out our [Quickstart Guide](https://visforvali.github.io/discord/) or the [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord) to get started and reach out if you need help!

## Technology 🌐

We'll use 2 platforms (plus occasional use of Classes) this semester. Here's what they're used for:

- **Discord**: Discussion forum for class meetings, text chats, communication, announcements, c
- **Course Website**: This site, where course content is posted.
- **Classes**: Platform for submitting assignments and viewing grades. You should be automatically added to Classes.

{: .important }
> We won't use Classes *except* for me to do enrollment verification, collect your major project submissions, and submit your grades.

# Required Materials

All required readings are provided for free. They're uploaded to Classes\Content\Read All the Things! and are linked in the [Calendar](/calendar.md) on this website for your convenience.

In addition, you'll need: 

- A notebook/paper for journaling by hand (if you're disabled and require assistive , )
- A short prose book of your choosing that you wouldn't mind parting with. It can be fiction, nonfiction, a book you already own, or a book bought for this purpose, but it has to be a book you're willing to destroy.

# Assignments and Grading Breakdown

## Grading Breakdown

Participation | 40%
High-Stakes Writing | 50%
Low-Stakes Writing Completion | 10%

# Ungrading

## Participation

You're expected to regularly, substantively participate through thoughtful, informal contributions in text channels and sync class sessions that reflect what we're learning organically reacting/replying to classmates; doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion; and attending coffee chats.

## Writing Activities

### Low-Stakes (Ungraded) Writing

You'll briefly organize your thoughts in writing in threads on on Discord once or twice a week (check the Calendar for due dates) to synthesize your experience of reading texts and engaging in interactive fiction into writing that opens up new futurities. 

{: .important }
> These assignments may not be graded but completing them is essential to succeeding on the assignments that are. Thus, they're factored into your final course grade on a completion basis (provided they aim to follow the assignment instructions). 

I try to open these threads in advance and leave them unlocked so you can reply at any time and pace yourself if needed, but please keep in mind that I can't read late submissions except when warranted by extenuating circumstances or unless alternate deadlines were arranged in advance.

### High-Stakes (Graded) Writing

Over the course of the semester, you'll compose an anthology of rough drafts and false starts that borrow from the craft techniques of the assigned readings and that are generated through the interactive fiction and single-player journaling games we'll play together as a class or in teams for this purpose. A lot of this work will be drafted and commented on when we play together and when you submit low-stakes writing activities. Later in the semester, you'll submit an ungraded draft of this anthology and revise it using feedback from your teammates and me. 

## Redemption Quests

When you participate in voice chat during sync class sessions (whether what you say is correct or not) or are very proactive and conversational in our server's text channels, e.g., #💻classroom or #🔢team, I'll add a "raffle ticket" number by your name in my roster. You can earn up to 3 tickets a week and trade them in at the end of the semester for a boost to your final course grade, e.g. 10 tickets for 1%.

{: .note }
> Using GenAI for anything in this course will automatically disqualify you from either of these two opportunities. 

If you do better on an ungraded draft than you do on a final submission, I'll score that one instead. This lowers the stakes of drafting even further, allows you to take risks and "fail up" without penalty, and more closely resembles what out-of-classroom drafting is really like: often "one step forward, two steps back," recursive, nonlinear, never quite finished.
