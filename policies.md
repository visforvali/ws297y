# WS 297Y Policies

UNGRADING
You‚Äôre guaranteed at least a B+ as your final grade if you do everything that‚Äôs asked of you in the spirit you‚Äôre asked to do it. 
Grading is the worst part of teaching (for me) and learning (for you). Grades cause anxiety, self-doubt, combativeness, plagiarism, and AI use. To counter this, I use an ‚Äúungrading‚Äù schema: a system that prioritizes learning over grades and rewards experimentation and even the screw-ups that happen when we try out what we‚Äôre learning.
Nothing in this class needs to be perfect or polished, but this doesn‚Äôt mean anything goes. I can‚Äôt measure how hard you feel you tried or give ‚Äúeffort points‚Äù for work that ignores the course material. I need measurable evidence of how you‚Äôre engaging in the class: e.g., frequency of participation, use of feedback, your writerly choices in assignments, etc.
There‚Äôs a basic checklist of ungrading expectations at the end of this document. You can always check in with me if you‚Äôre unsure of how you‚Äôre doing!


SCORING & LATE WORK
I‚Äôll emoji react to Discord posts to show how it was received (see #syllabus-rules for an emoji key). Low-stakes work that engages in the class or does an activity, even imperfectly, is usually accepted for credit. I accept both prewriting and essay drafts with no penalty or questions asked for 1 week after the initial deadline, but I can‚Äôt promptly review it. After 1 week, the work will not receive credit.


## ACCESSIBILITY
I want you to succeed! If something might affect your performance, please let me know ASAP so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. You don‚Äôt need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether due to disability, mental health, work, family, stress, etc., and you don‚Äôt need to disclose personal info, either. 
To get official university accommodations, you‚Äôll need to register and request accommodations through the Office of Disability Services (FAQs here). Ms. Elisse Geberth, Coordinator of Disability Services, can be contacted at egeberth@pace.edu or 914-773-3710.

## COVID & ILLNESS
The pandemic isn‚Äôt over. For information on how to affordably protect yourself, refer to the course policy on illness.

## "CHECK IN WEEKLY"


If you select the "Check in Weekly" role on Discord in #get-roles, I'll DM you every week with basic questions about how you're doing, reminders to participate, and if you'd like to chat sometime, to help you surmount any anxiety about having to contact me first.

I expect to synchronously chat with you 3+ times, but 

You can DM me for any reason at any time.

A NOTE ON BEING HUMAN & ATTENDANCE POLICY
Life is stressful: We‚Äôre dealing with changes in government and social policy‚Äîcuts to open education, equity initiatives that support women, BIPOC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ folks, social welfare, FEMA, the VA; bans on public health and science communications; attacks on citizenship and ICE raids‚Äîand ongoing problems like the rising cost of living; weather extremes and environmental disasters; gun violence; AI deepfakes and misinformation; food recalls; medication shortages; and an uptick in anti-intellectualism and bigotry. 
Naturally, all this can impact your class performance, gradually or suddenly. Your participation might also falter due to sickness (see the illness policy), religious holidays, and/or Pace-affiliated extracurricular activities. At the same time, because much of our knowledge-making happens during class sessions, your attendance‚Äîactively participating, not just passively existing in the classroom‚Äîis critical to your success. 
A significant part of your course grade comes from consistent, informal weekly participation (i.e., the more you post, react, and chat with each other in #week, #team, #lounge, etc., the better!). If you need a ballpark number: aim for 2-3 oral, textual, meme-based, etc. voice and/or text chats during sync sessions, and/or 2-3 async text chats during the week if you were quiet during sync session, missed class, or are looking to boost your overall participation. 

You‚Äôre responsible for reaching out to me in a timely fashion to arrange alternate deadlines and make sure you‚Äôre on the right track, and for submitting any written assignments, reviewing the week‚Äôs materials, and asking for notes or help in #week, #lounge, or #team. If you‚Äôre dealing with issues or a schedule that will affect your performance, please proactively talk to me. Barring emergencies, I need as much advance notice as possible to effectively accommodate you. You don‚Äôt need to disclose any more details than you wish. You can just tell me you‚Äôre dealing with stuff, and then we can strategize ways for you to fulfill the course requirements while taking care of yourself. 
FORMS OF PARTICIPATION
Participation takes a lot of forms! It means talking out loud, posting in #week each week, in #team for peer review and other activities, and #lounge to crowdsource info and ‚Äúbuddy-work‚Äù with peers. It means organically replying and reacting to your classmates‚Äô posts (no boring ‚Äúdiscussion board‚Äù-style replies please!), coming to coffee chats, helping your peers, etc. It means DMing me for clarification, or before an absence or a class you know will be an ‚Äúoff day‚Äù to ask me to say something in class for you. These are all measurable, valid forms of participation! If there‚Äôs another form that works for you, or if you‚Äôre anxious about how you‚Äôre participating, please proactively reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we‚Äôll need to meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw.
WRITING SUPPORT SERVICES
Writing support is available for all students at Pace University. Writing Support Services offers confidential one-to-one appointments (in person or online), group sessions, and drop-in sessions free of charge.‚ÄØStudents can bring writing from all disciplines and at all stages of the writing process, from outlines to completed drafts. Students are encouraged to bring all types of writing, including resumes, internship and graduate school applications, and personal creative work. Writing Support Tutors are dedicated to developing independent learners through purposeful interactions with trained, well-qualified peer and professional staff. For more information about writing services and current hours of operation, please visit the Learning Commons website. You can also schedule an appointment using TracCloud. Questions? Please email LC (PLV) or LC (NYC), or visit Mortola Library, 3rd floor (PLV) or 15 Beekman, 7th floor (NYC).
TUTORING AT THE LEARNING COMMONS
The Learning Commons uses an array of programs and a holistic approach to assist students with academic skills and content knowledge. We are dedicated to developing independent learners through purposeful interactions with trained, well-qualified peer and professional staff, such as:
‚Ä¢	Content Support Services including, content tutoring, exam review sessions, and content preparation/support workshops
‚Ä¢	Academic Skills Services including small group peer mentoring, academic skills workshops, and individual academic development
‚Ä¢	Writing Support Services including, writing tutoring and writing preparation/support workshops
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY CODE & AI REFUSAL
You‚Äôre responsible for following the Academic Integrity Code in the Student Handbook. In short: do your own work, and don‚Äôt use AI. Low-stakes writing can be used in your essay drafts, but you may not reuse essay drafts (unless the assignment asks you to cumulatively build on them). When you use sources, cite them whether you‚Äôre paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text‚Äôs words). Don‚Äôt invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, or pass off another human‚Äôs or OpenAI‚Äôs responses as your own. All violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee. 
Along these lines, I don‚Äôt accept AI-generated writing, which is embroiled in legal battles and ethical problems around copyright infringement, identity theft, and encouraging self-harm, suicide, and sexual assault. If you choose to use AI, I expect you to do all the necessary fact-checking, rewriting to fit the assignment‚Äôs rhetorical context and genre, and providing attribution for the sources OpenAI is using. For reasons of copyright infringement, you may not upload material from this class (my materials or your peers‚Äô submissions) to OpenAI databases. Here‚Äôs more on using and refusing AI.
SAFETY STATEMENT
If you feel you have experienced a threat to your safety, or if you have been sexually assaulted, there are resources available at the university to assist you. Faculty (like me) are non-confidential resources and have an obligation to report any information about sexual assault to the Executive Director of Institutional Equity/Title IX Compliance and Title IX Coordinator, Bernard Dufresne, who may be reached at 914-923-2610 or by email. The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX Compliance is responsible for investigating violations of the sex-based misconduct policy (available here). The university‚Äôs confidential resources are:
‚Ä¢	The Pace University Counseling Center, Administration Building, 2nd floor, 914-773-3710
‚Ä¢	Office of Sexual and Interpersonal Wellness, Elm Hall, 212-346-1931, jverrengia@pace.edu
‚Ä¢	University Healthcare, Paton House, ground floor, 914-773-3760
I encourage you to report sex-based misconduct to the university and, where applicable, to local law enforcement.
