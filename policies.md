# This Class &: Alt-Grading 💯

You’re guaranteed at least a B+ as your final grade if you do everything that’s asked of you in the spirit you’re asked to do it. 
Grading is the worst part of teaching (for me) and learning (for you). Grades cause anxiety, self-doubt, combativeness, plagiarism, and AI use. To counter this, I use an “ungrading” schema: a system that prioritizes learning over grades and rewards experimentation and even the screw-ups that happen when we try out what we’re learning.
Nothing in this class needs to be perfect or polished, but this doesn’t mean anything goes. I can’t measure how hard you feel you tried or give “effort points” for work that ignores the course material. I need measurable evidence of how you’re engaging in the class: e.g., frequency of participation, use of feedback, your writerly choices in assignments, etc.
There’s a basic checklist of ungrading expectations at the end of this document. You can always check in with me if you’re unsure of how you’re doing!



If you do better on an ungraded draft than you do on a final submission, I'll score that one instead. This lowers the stakes of drafting even further, allows you to take risks and "fail up" without penalty, and more closely resembles what out-of-classroom drafting is really like: often "one step forward, two steps back," recursive, nonlinear, never quite finished.



SCORING & LATE WORK
I’ll emoji react to Discord posts to show how it was received (see #syllabus-rules for an emoji key). Low-stakes work that engages in the class or does an activity, even imperfectly, is usually accepted for credit. I accept both prewriting and essay drafts with no penalty or questions asked for 1 week after the initial deadline, but I can’t promptly review it. After 1 week, the work will not receive credit.


## Redemption Quest

When you participate in voice chat during sync class sessions (whether what you say is correct or not) or are very proactive and conversational in our server's text channels, e.g., #classroom or #team, I'll note it in my roster as a "raffle ticket." You can earn up to 3 tickets a week and trade them in at the end of the semester for a boost to your final course grade, with I'll let you know in the last week of the semester if there will be any other grade-related opportunities "raffled" off at the end of semester.

{: .note }
> 6 tickets equals 1%. Using GenAI for *anything* in this course will automatically disqualify you from these opportunities. 



# This Class &: Accessibility and Student Support ♿

I want you to succeed! If something might affect or is affecting your academic performance, **please talk to me ASAP** so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. You don't need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether it's because of disability, mental health challenges, work, family, stress, etc., and you don't need to disclose personal info, either.

## Pace &: Student Accessibility Services

To request an accommodation for a qualifying disability a student must self-identify and register with the [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services){:target="_blank"} for his/her/their campus. Student Accessibility Services for the New York City campus may be contacted at (212) 346-1199 or 161 William St, 10th Floor. Student Accessibility Services for the Westchester campuses may be contacted at (914) 773-3201 or the Administration Center, 861 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. 


# This Class &: Attendance Policy 🙋

{ .important }
> The pandemic isn't over. For information on how to affordably protect yourself from infectious diseases, refer to this informational resource I put together on [pandemics and public health](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/pandemics-public-health/){:target="_blank"}, which includes info on current strains, long-term costs of COVID-19 and post-COVID syndromes, where to buy PPE affordably, and an abbreviated course policy on illness.

Life is stressful: We're dealing with changes in government and social policy &mdash; cuts to open education, equity initiatives that support women, BIPOC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ folks, social welfare, FEMA, the VA; bans on public health and science communications; attacks on citizenship and ICE raids &mdash; and ongoing problems like the rising cost of living; weather extremes and environmental disasters; gun violence; GenAI's destruction of environment, human intentionality, and reliable information; food recalls; medication shortages; and an uptick in anti-intellectualism and bigotry. 

Naturally, all this can impact your class performance, gradually or suddenly. Your participation might also falter due to sickness, religious holidays, and/or Pace-affiliated extracurricular activities. At the same time, because much of our knowledge-making happens during class sessions, your attendance is critical to your success. 

{ .warning }
> In this class, attendance doesn't mean showing up and passively existing. You have to actively participate to be counted as present. If a ballpark number helps, aim for 2-3 contributions during each sync session; in weeks when you're quieter in class, or if you're looking to boost your overall participation, aim for 2-3 substantive text chats outside of class (in addition to homework posts).

Since a large part of your course grade comes from consistent, active participation, the more you post, react, and chat with each other in and out of class, the better &mdash; and since actively participating is how learning happens, it'll help you do better on assignments, too! If you miss a class, you're responsible for reaching out to me in a timely fashion to arrange alternate deadlines and make sure you're on the right track, and for submitting any written assignments, reviewing the week's materials, and asking for notes or help on Discord. 

{ .warning }
> If you're dealing with issues or a schedule that will affect your performance, please proactively talk to me. Barring emergencies, I need as much advance notice as possible to effectively accommodate you. You don’t need to disclose any more details than you wish. You can just tell me you’re dealing with stuff, and then we can strategize ways for you to fulfill the course requirements while taking care of yourself. 

If you think you might have caught COVID-19 or the flu, as soon as you feel symptomatic (even if you suspect it's allergies), *get tested*! The average length of time for contagiousness is 9 days after symptom onset, and breakthrough infections can occur regardless of vaccination status, especially if you aren't consistently masking indoors. It's possible to become reinfected with COVID-19 within two weeks of having had it, and with a variant you've previously been infected with.

If you test positive, prioritize your recovery and don't attend class. I trust you to reach out to me when you are well enough to resume participating, and we'll get you caught up then. No one learns well while sick, anyway. If you can, quarantine until you test negative on a PCR test. Try to limit your physical, cognitive, and emotional activity as much as possible for 4-6 weeks after you get COVID-19 to reduce your risk of developing a permanently disabling condition.

As a high-risk disabled individual myself, if I become sick, especially with COVID-19 or another serious illness, I'll need to aggressively rest. You'll have the materials on Classes &mdash; texts, videos, other resources &mdash; and each other on Discord to help you continue with your learning. I'll rejoin when I'm well enough.

I don't want any of us risking our well-being for this class, but I can only overextend myself so much &mdash; meaning I can't give unlimited extensions if everyone keeps getting sick. The more you reduce your risk of getting sick, the more likely we are to finish the course without significant interruptions to course continuity and your learning. And if you do get sick, communicate with me early so we can make a plan to make a plan when you're better.

Remember: we are in this together, so communal care, mutual aid, and compassion will get us through!

## "Check in Weekly!" Role

If you select the "Check in Weekly" role on Discord in #get-roles, I'll encourage you to participate each week by DMing you every Monday with basic questions about how you're doing, if you're confused about the materials, and if you'd like to chat sometime. If you need help surmounting any anxiety about reaching out to your professors, choose this role, and reply to me when I reach out to you to get the conversation going!



# Pace &: Writing Support Services

WRITING SUPPORT SERVICES
Writing support is available for all students at Pace University. Writing Support Services offers confidential one-to-one appointments (in person or online), group sessions, and drop-in sessions free of charge. Students can bring writing from all disciplines and at all stages of the writing process, from outlines to completed drafts.

•	Writing Support Services including, writing tutoring and writing preparation/support workshops
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY CODE & AI REFUSAL
You’re responsible for following the Academic Integrity Code in the Student Handbook. In short: do your own work, and don’t use AI. Low-stakes writing can be used in your essay drafts, but you may not reuse essay drafts (unless the assignment asks you to cumulatively build on them). When you use sources, cite them whether you’re paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text’s words). Don’t invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, or pass off another human’s or OpenAI’s responses as your own. All violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee. 
Along these lines, I don’t accept AI-generated writing, which is embroiled in legal battles and ethical problems around copyright infringement, identity theft, and encouraging self-harm, suicide, and sexual assault. If you choose to use AI, I expect you to do all the necessary fact-checking, rewriting to fit the assignment’s rhetorical context and genre, and providing attribution for the sources OpenAI is using. For reasons of copyright infringement, you may not upload material from this class (my materials or your peers’ submissions) to OpenAI databases. Here’s more on using and refusing AI.
SAFETY STATEMENT
If you feel you have experienced a threat to your safety, or if you have been sexually assaulted, there are resources available at the university to assist you. Faculty (like me) are non-confidential resources and have an obligation to report any information about sexual assault to the Executive Director of Institutional Equity/Title IX Compliance and Title IX Coordinator, Bernard Dufresne, who may be reached at 914-923-2610 or by email. The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX Compliance is responsible for investigating violations of the sex-based misconduct policy (available here). The university’s confidential resources are:
•	The Pace University Counseling Center, Administration Building, 2nd floor, 914-773-3710
•	Office of Sexual and Interpersonal Wellness, Elm Hall, 212-346-1931, jverrengia@pace.edu
•	University Healthcare, Paton House, ground floor, 914-773-3760
I encourage you to report sex-based misconduct to the university and, where applicable, to local law enforcement.
