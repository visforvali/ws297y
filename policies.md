# This Class &: Alt-Grading 💯

{: .warning }
> You're guaranteed *at least* a B+ as your final grade if you do everything that's asked of you in the spirit you're asked to do it. But this doesn't mean anything goes! Read on for details.

{: important }
GenAI is not permitted in this class. I also don't police it specifically. If a submission sounds "off" for any reason, and if you're unable to walk me through the writing choices you made and why (what you hoped to accomplish, how your thoughts and wordsmithing were supposed to get you there), then I'm unlikely to accept that submission for credit.

Grading is the worst part of teaching (for me) and learning (for you). Grades cause anxiety, self-doubt, combativeness, plagiarism, and GenAI use. To counter this, I use an "ungrading" schema: a system that prioritizes learning over grades and rewards experimentation and even the screw-ups that happen when we try out what we're learning

Nothing in this class needs to be perfect or polished, but this doesn't mean anything goes. I can't measure how hard you feel you tried or give "effort points" for work that ignores the course material. I need measurable evidence of how you're engaging in the class: e.g., frequency of participation, use of feedback, your writerly choices in assignments, etc.

## Scoring Discord Posts 🔥

Low-stakes writing, i.e. responses to writing prompts or team activities, that actively engages with the material and is unafraid of "getting things wrong" on the way to figuring things out is usually accepted for credit. 

If I can't accept a submission for credit for substantive reasons, I'll DM you privately to let you know.

I use emojis as a form of interaction, to give you a sense of how I'm reading and responding to your contributions. 

## 1 Wk Grace Period for Late Work 🗓️

I accept writing assignments with no penalty or questions asked within 1 week of the original deadline (as long as they meet the rest of the assignment criteria). Please note that I can't promptly review late work. I don't accept work more than 1 week late (unless we made alternate arrangements in advance).

{: important }
> This grace period doesn't apply to a lack of participation, which can't be made up once the week has passed unless we've made alternate arrangements. 

## Basic Checklist ✅

For you to earn at least a B+ in this class, you must:

- Complete *all* required activities and assignments by the deadline, within the 1-week grace period for late work (where permitted) after the original deadline, or by an alternate deadline that was arranged in advance with me.
- Attempt to write nearly all of the components of required assignments in each draft.
- Regularly incorporate feedback and what you learn in class in your assignments.
- Show that you're paying attention to the instructions, the readings, and feedback by thoughtfully making writerly decisions (choice of readings, interpretive approach, craft and style, etc.) in your assignments.
- Regularly participate in voice and text chat every week.
- Proactively try to figure things out on your own before chatting with me, scheduling coffee chats, and by bringing relevant notes, annotated readings, and writing materials to these meetings so we can work on them together.
- Talk/post about what you've learned when you participate each week: from the readings, from accumulating discussions and activities, from feedback, and/or from your peers' posts (and try to participate even when you aren't sure you’re right!).
- Be open to critique and accountable for the work you did (or didn't do).

You can always check in with me if you’re unsure of how you're doing!

If you do better on an ungraded draft than you do on a final submission, I'll score that one instead. This lowers the stakes of drafting even further, allows you to take risks and "fail up" without penalty, and more closely resembles what out-of-classroom drafting is really like: often "one step forward, two steps back," recursive, nonlinear, never quite finished.

## Redemption Points 🎟️

When you participate in voice chat during sync class sessions (whether what you say is correct or not) or are very proactive and conversational in our server's text channels, e.g., #classroom or #team, I'll note it in my roster as a "redemption point." You can earn up to 3 redemption points a week and trade them in at the end of the semester for a boost to your final course grade.

{: .note }
> 6 points equals 1%. Using GenAI for *anything* in this course will automatically disqualify you from these opportunities. 

# This Class &: Accessibility and Student Support ♿

I want you to succeed! If something might affect or is affecting your academic performance, **please talk to me ASAP** so we can work together to meet your needs and the course reqs. You don't need documentation to talk to me about issues impacting your learning, whether it's because of disability, mental health challenges, work, family, stress, etc., and you don't need to disclose personal info, either.

## Pace &: Student Accessibility Services

To request an accommodation for a qualifying disability a student must self-identify and register with the [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.pace.edu/student-accessibility-services){:target="_blank"} for his/her/their campus. Student Accessibility Services for the New York City campus may be contacted at (212) 346-1199 or 161 William St, 10th Floor. Student Accessibility Services for the Westchester campuses may be contacted at (914) 773-3201 or the Administration Center, 861 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. 

# This Class &: Attendance Policy 🙋

{ .important }
> The pandemic isn't over. For information on how to affordably protect yourself from infectious diseases, refer to this informational resource I put together on [pandemics and public health](https://vyshalimanivannan.com/pandemics-public-health/){:target="_blank"}, which includes info on current strains, long-term costs of COVID-19 and post-COVID syndromes, where to buy PPE affordably, and an abbreviated course policy on illness.

Life is stressful: We're dealing with changes in government and social policy &mdash; cuts to open education, equity initiatives that support women, BIPOC, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ folks, social welfare, FEMA, the VA; bans on public health and science communications; attacks on citizenship and ICE raids &mdash; and ongoing problems like the rising cost of living; weather extremes and environmental disasters; gun violence; GenAI's destruction of environment, human intentionality, and reliable information; food recalls; medication shortages; and an uptick in anti-intellectualism and bigotry. 

Naturally, all this can impact your class performance, gradually or suddenly. Your participation might also falter due to sickness, religious holidays, and/or Pace-affiliated extracurricular activities. At the same time, because much of our knowledge-making happens during class sessions, your attendance is critical to your success. 

{ .important }
> In this class, attendance doesn't mean showing up and passively existing. You have to actively participate to be counted as present. If a ballpark number helps, aim for 2-3 contributions during each sync session; in weeks when you're quieter in class, or if you're looking to boost your overall participation, aim for 2-3 substantive text chats outside of class (in addition to homework posts).

Since a large part of your course grade comes from consistent, active participation, the more you post, react, and chat with each other in and out of class, the better &mdash; and since actively participating is how learning happens, it'll help you do better on assignments, too! If you miss a class, you're responsible for reaching out to me in a timely fashion to arrange alternate deadlines and make sure you're on the right track, and for submitting any written assignments, reviewing the week's materials, and asking for notes or help on Discord. 

{ .warning }
> If you're dealing with issues or a schedule that will affect your performance, please proactively talk to me. Barring emergencies, I need as much advance notice as possible to effectively accommodate you. You don’t need to disclose any more details than you wish. You can just tell me you’re dealing with stuff, and then we can strategize ways for you to fulfill the course requirements while taking care of yourself. 

If you think you might have caught COVID-19 or the flu, as soon as you feel symptomatic (even if you suspect it's allergies), *get tested*! The average length of time for contagiousness is 9 days after symptom onset, and breakthrough infections can occur regardless of vaccination status, especially if you aren't consistently masking indoors. It's possible to become reinfected with COVID-19 within two weeks of having had it, and with a variant you've previously been infected with.

If you test positive, prioritize your recovery and don't attend class. I trust you to reach out to me when you are well enough to resume participating, and we'll get you caught up then. No one learns well while sick, anyway. If you can, quarantine until you test negative on a PCR test. Try to limit your physical, cognitive, and emotional activity as much as possible for 4-6 weeks after you get COVID-19 to reduce your risk of developing a permanently disabling condition.

As a high-risk disabled individual myself, if I become sick, especially with COVID-19 or another serious illness, I'll need to aggressively rest. You'll have the materials on Classes &mdash; texts, videos, other resources &mdash; and each other on Discord to help you continue with your learning. I'll rejoin when I'm well enough.

I don't want any of us risking our well-being for this class, but I can only overextend myself so much &mdash; meaning I can't give unlimited extensions if everyone keeps getting sick. The more you reduce your risk of getting sick, the more likely we are to finish the course without significant interruptions to course continuity and your learning. And if you do get sick, communicate with me early so we can make a plan to make a plan when you're better.

Remember: we are in this together, so communal care, mutual aid, and compassion will get us through!

# Writing-Enhanced Course Statement




# Pace &: Academic Integrity Code 🧠

{ .important }
> In accordance with university policy, all violations of academic integrity will be reported to your academic adviser and the Academic Conduct Committee. 

You're responsible for following Pace's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/pace-university-academic-integrity-code.pdf){:target="_blank"}. In short: Do your own work, and don't use AI. If you use sources, including the assigned texts, cite them whether you're paraphrasing (translating the text into your own voice) or quoting (using the text's words). Don't invent research data, lie about engaging with a text, fabricate a source, or pass off another human's or GenAI model's responses as your own. 

Low-stakes writing assignments can be &mdash; are meant to be, even! &mdash; repurposed in your essay drafts, but you can't reuse the same pieces of writing across multiple assignments (unless the assignment asks you to cumulatively build on them). 

## This Class &: Writing with(out) GenAI 🤖

{: .warning }
> The use of GenAI for *any* purpose isn't permitted in this class. If you take that risk, you're responsible for necessary fact-checking, rewriting to fit the assignment's rhetorical context and genre, and providing attribution for all the sources GenAI is using. For reasons of copyright infringement, you may not upload material from this class (my materials or your peers' submissions) to GenAI models.

Writing is thinking. Therefore, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) technologies have no place at any stage of the writing process. Writing is painstaking work we do to refine our ideas and communicate them to others. LLMs are designed to produce plausible sounding permutations of text, with no ideas or thought behind them. They violate academic integrity. They encourage delusion. They destroy the environment. They do all this to produce synthetic, mediocre text in the name of capitalistic imperatives. They reduce your capacity for thought, across human activity. They reduce human intentionality.
