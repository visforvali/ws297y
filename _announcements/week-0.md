Dear Students,

Welcome to Fall 2025 and WS 297Y: Creative Writing and Social Justice. 

By the first week of classes, you'll need to set yourself up for a successful semester by doing everything listed in Week 1 in the [Calendar](/calendar.md), including reviewing the Syllabus and other materials on this website, joining our Discord server (invitation link posted to Classes\Content\Syllabus) and setting up your server profile with a nickname/alias (for more info, check out [Customizing Your Profile](https://visforvali.github.io/ws297y/discord/#customizing-your-profile) in the Discord Tutorial).

We don't have a physical classroom. Our online classroom is our Discord server, WS297Y Classroom, where we'll talk and write and work together (for a quick guide to setting up Discord for this class, review the full [Discord Tutorial](/discord.md)).

Like physical buildings you aren't familiar with, Discord might initially seem confusing, but it's pretty intuitive with a little exploration, and additionally, won't steal your work or accuse you of plagiarism like many AI-integrated learning management systems, including Classes.

Can't wait to virtually meet you very soon!

üöÄ To infinity and beyond,
Dr. Mani (aka [fhqwhgads](https://homestarrunner.com/toons/everybody-to-the-limit){:target="_blank"})
