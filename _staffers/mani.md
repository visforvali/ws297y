I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. I've taught writing and rhetoric, media studies, disability studies, and cultural studies for ~20 years. In and out of the classroom, I'm interested in digital multimodal composition, disability justice movements (mask up ðŸ˜·!), body mods, and I have a Siberian cat named Athena ([cat tax](/ws297y/images/cat_tax.jpg){:target="_blank"}).
