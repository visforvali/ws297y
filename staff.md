# Staff

Staff information is stored in the `_staffers` directory and rendered according to the layout file, `_layouts/staffer.html`.

## Coffee Chats

I reserve 5 hours a week for by-appointment chats, but I'm often able to carve out time for DMs 

Drop-In Hour: Tue 2-5PM, Wed 12-2PM ðŸ”‰CafÃ©
Reserve 20min on Zcal: Mon 2-4PM, Thu 2-4PM
Or DM me for other times!

I respond to emails within 24 hrs during the week and to emails received over the weekend on Mon.

You can DM me on our class server or
