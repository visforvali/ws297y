{: .important }
> This "tl;dr (too long, didn't read)" tutorial goes over only the basics: fundamental controls; channel directory; and useful built-in or third-party-enabled functions. This guide is regularly updated based on user input and is designed to be read, referenced, and/or Ctrl+F'd as needed. For more in-depth documentation, check out the official [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord){:target="_blank"}.

{: .warning }
> If you've never used Discord, don't be intimidated! Discord's controls are a lot like text messaging or social media. You can get by with these 3 main functions: click #text channels on the left to enter them, type in the message box, and hit enter to send; click 🧵 and 📌 at the top of #text channels for a directory of threads (click a thread name to join and send messages in the panel that appears) and pinned posts; and click 🔊Voice channels on the left 1x to join voice-only and 2x to join voice-and-video.

# Getting Started

First, you'll need to install the Discord app and create an account. 

- **Download Discord**: Discord can be accessed via browser, but the desktop client is recommended for the best experience. Download it here: [Desktop Installation Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034561191-Desktop-Installation-Guide){:target="_blank"}. You can also download the Discord app through Google Play or Apple Store. Here's the full list of [Discord's OS/System Requirements](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/213491697-What-are-the-OS-system-requirements-for-Discord){:target="_blank"}.
- **Create an Account**: If you don't have a Discord account, the first step is to create one. The Discord desktop client will prompt you to do so the first time it's opened, or visit Discord's [registration page](https://discord.com/register){:target="_blank"} directly. Enter a valid email that you can access and that isn't associated with another Discord account and select a username that's case-insensitive/forced lowercase and between 2-32 characters (using a-z, 0-9, and . or _). 

_This username is not the same as your display name, the prominent name shown when you interact in a server or in direct messages (DMs), which can be changed later._

Once you've completed the registration and verification process, use the Discord server invitation link on Classes to add yourself to the WS 297Y server. Refer to Discord's [Getting Started](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started){:target="_blank"} guide for additional help if needed.

## Code of Conduct

Our priority is the privacy, security, and safety of the server. By joining, you are agreeing to these rules:

- Be civil, respectful, and considerate towards other members. No hate speech or discriminatory language or behavior of any kind will be tolerated.
- Server invitations are for this class only and are set to expire for the safety of our community. Never share an invite publicly.
- Keep everything said here confidential. Don't screenshot or share content without express permission. Anyone who does this will be banned and the content shared will be reported.
- If you're made uncomfortable, bring your concerns to the facilitators and moderators.
- Read member profiles before replying or DMing them, to make sure you're using their preferred pronouns and accommodating any listed access needs.
- Don't spam channels or members' direct messages.
- Dont post age-restricted or obscene content (this includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or anything else that's graphically disturbing).
- Harassment, trolling, and malicious shitposting will not be tolerated.
- Communicate accessibly! Create threads to organize conversations as needed; avoid terms rooted in ableism and discrimination (refer to [Ableist Terms and Words to Avoid](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html){:target="_blank"} for guidance); use alt-text and tone indicators (for guidance, check out [Alt Text as Poetry](https://tinyurl.com/yhfnfn3a){:target="_blank"} and [Tone Indicators](https://tinyurl.com/y8x2urop){:target="_blank"}); and enable Live Captioning on your OS/browser for captions in voice channels (Discord doesn't yet have built-in captioning).
- Call in people when they've crossed a line or are talking over someone (or @ or DM me) so we can have dialogue around uncomfortable moments.
- Respond to me if I DM you with a concern. If you don't respond for a few days or if a safety concern doesn't get addressed, I might notify your advisor to make sure you're okay, or issue a warning or timeout until the situation can be resolved. 

## Customizing Your Profile

Your profile picture (PFP), username, and user settings (cogwheel icon ⚙️) are visible at the bottom left of the screen. Open the Edit Profile screen to change your display name and PFP for this server. You can do this by:

- Clicking your username in the lower right, then Edit Profile in the opened pop-up, or 
- Clicking the ⚙️ icon next to your username to open the User Settings screen, then Profiles in the opened menu.

Any changes you make to your Main Profile are visible on all servers you belong to; the Per-Server Profiles menu allows you to use different display names and pronouns on different servers.

### Main Profile 
{:.no_toc}

Under the Main Profile menu, enter your **preferred display name and pronouns**. Click Change Avatar and upload the image &mdash; a photograph, image, or icon (you can use Picrew to create non-AI-generated avatars for personal, noncommercial use) &mdash; you’d like to use. 

Below that, you have the option of editing the **banner color** on your profile and entering text into the **About Me** section. If you're stuck on what to say, here are two placeholders you can copy-paste and modify:

 ✎┊ (Name) \\
╭────────────╯ \\
│•(Reading) \\
│•(Watching) \\
│•(Playing) \\
│•(Teaching) \\
╰─────────── · · · · ✦ \\
\\
 ✎┊ (Name) \\
⬛🟪🟪🟪⬛⬛🟩⬛⬛ \\

⬛⬛⬛⬛🟨🟧🟧🟩🟦 \\
⬛⬛🟨🟨🟨🟧🟧🟥🟦 \\
⬛⬛🟩🟩🟪⬛🟥🟥🟦 \\
⬛🟩🟩🟪🟪🟪🟥⬛🟦 \\
\\
Finally, you can add or change your status by hovering over the thought bubble next to your avatar and clicking ✏️; choose an emoji, enter text, and select when you want the status to be cleared in the dropdown menu. (You can add or change your online status by exiting this menu, clicking your username, then hovering over your status and selecting 🟢 Online, 🌘 Idle, ⛔ Do Not Disturb, or 🟣 Invisible.)

### Per-Server Profile
{:.no_toc}

To change your per-server nickname, click the Edit Per-Server Profile tab, choose the Kairos RTP server from the dropdown menu (if your account is associated with other servers), and change your nickname and pronouns for our server.\\

# What's Where

Now that you’ve retooled your profile and user preferences, it's time to familiarize yourself with our server!

When you joined the WS 297Y server, you should have landed in the #welcome channel, which contains a link to this quickstart guide and instructions to select your roles and introduce yourself.

Discord consists of a main view in the center (for interactions in text or voice channels), a left panel, an optional member list on the right that shows a list of current server members and their online status (which can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the 👥 icon at the top), and the Direct Messages view.

- **Main View**: In text channels, the chat bar is located at the bottom-center of the screen. The **message box is where you type your messages (which are visible to all members of the channel). In voice channels, the main view displays the users in the voice channel and the controls
- **Right Panel**: In the expanded Member List view, you can click on a user's name to read their profile (display name, username, pronouns, server roles, status, and About Me) or direct message (DM) them. Server roles are color coded; the color of the "highest" role (staff position) is the color of the member's display name in the list.
- **Direct Messages**: DMs are only visible to you and the recipient. You can send DMs by clicking a user's name in the expanded Member List, or by clicking the upper-left Discord icon, which will open up your DM history. You can also start a one-on-one call through DMs. In your DM history, click the name of the user you want to call, then click the phone 📞 or video 📹 icon in the upper right to start a voice or video chat.

## Category and Channel Directory
{:.no_toc}

The left panel contains category headings and channels. Clicking a channel in the left panel will highlight it and open the channel’s content in the main view in the center of the screen.

- On Discord's channel list, categories appear in 【brackets】, channels beginning with # are text-only (i.e., text- and image-based chat), and channels beginning with 🔊 are voice-only (with the option for text chat within the voice channel). 
- You can click category names to minimize or expand each category.

_If you react to a message with ⭐, the message will be cross-posted to #⭐│starboard, along with a link to the original message._

### Threads
{:.no_toc}

Threads (of 3+ messages) organize conversations into dedicated spaces within a single channel. For in-depth documentation, refer to [Discord's Thread FAQs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ){:target="_blank"}.

- **Closing/Opening Threads**: Threads will close &mdash; become hidden from view &mdash; after about 3-7 days to declutter the channel sidebar. Closing a thread doesn't delete it. You can manually close a thread by clicking the More ⋯ icon at the top of the thread, then Close Thread. To reopen a closed thread, you can send a message in the thread, or click the More ⋯ icon and then Open Thread. This will make the thread reappear in the threads tab in the channel sidebar.
- **Join/Leave Thread**: To join an active thread, click the thread you want to join and send a message in it, or click the More ⋯ icon and then Join Thread. To leave a thread, click the the More ⋯ icon and then Leave Thread.

### Voice Messages (Mobile)
{:.no_toc}

In text channels where you can send messages, you also send voice messages, a mobile-only function. To send a voice message, use the mobile app, open the text channel where you want to send your message, and press and hold the microphone 🎙️ icon to the right of the chat box, and record your message. Release the 🎙️ to send the message.

## Voice Channels

For in-depth documentation, refer to [Discord's Voice Channel FAQs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19583625604887-Voice-Channels-FAQs){:target="_blank"}.

- **Join Voice Chat (without view)**: By clicking a voice channel once, you'll join voice chat while retaining text channels in the main view, allowing you to listen, speak, and navigate text channels simultaneously.
- **Join Voice Chat (with view)**: By clicking a voice channel twice, you'll highlight the channel and open the video feed in the main view, which includes a grid of participants and a control bar that appears on hover at the bottom of the screen.

<img src="http://visforvali.github.io/ws297y/assets/images/voice.gif" alt="How to join, open, and engage with voice channels">

### Text Chat in Voice
{:.no_toc}

Voice channels also support in-channel texting. Hover over the voice channel (or right-click it) and click the Open Chat 💬 icon that appears to the right of the voice channel name. This will automatically open the text chat for that voice channel. Alternatively, click the voice channel twice to fully open it and click the Open Chat 💬 icon in the top right corner.

The control bar at the bottom of the main view contains: Mute/Unmute 🎙️ icon, Camera On/Off 🎥 icon, 📲 Share Screen, and the More ⋯ icon, which contains controls for Grid View, Show My Own Camera, Show Non-Video Participants, Show New Message Previews, and Voice and Video Settings ⚙️. At the end of the control bar is the Disconnect icon 📞.

Whether you enter a voice channel or pull it up in the main view, a panel will appear just above your username in the lower-left corner, containing the same controls along with Deafen 🎧 (which allows you to mute yourself and block incoming audio, including voice chat, server notifications, and DM alerts). You can access voice channel controls here when you don’t have it open in the main view.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter installer errors, the following steps might help (Windows instructions [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209099387){:target="_blank"}; MacOS instructions [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022082931--macOS-Install-and-Updating-Errors){:target="_blank"}).

First, make sure that your computer is fully updated and that your operating system and drivers are current and that Discord is fully updated as well. You may need to allow the app through your antivirus or firewall protection as well (check Microsoft or Apple support as needed). Check that you granted Discord permission to use your microphone and camera (if you're using the app) or to your browser (if you're using the web version). 

If you have difficulty using voice channels, you can try turning off acceleration: navigate to User Settings (the gear icon next to your name), then click Voice & Video and turn off both OpenH264 Video Codec and H.264 Hardware Acceleration; then scroll down in the left-hand pane, click Advanced,  and turn off Hardware Acceleration. You can also download the app on your mobile phone, where voice and video might run more seamlessly. 

For more in-depth documentation, refer to [Discord's Support page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.
