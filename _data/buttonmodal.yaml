title: Acceptable Participation
text: You're expected to regularly, substantively participate through thoughtful, informal contributions in text channels and sync class sessions that reflect what we're learning organically reacting/replying to classmates; doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion; and attending coffee chats. 

Participation takes a lot of forms! These are all measurable, valid forms of participation: 
  - Talking out loud
  - Posting on Discord during and outside of classtime
  - Reading and writing with classmates
  - Organically replying and reacting to classmates' posts (no boring "discussion board"-style replies, please!)
  - Working with me in coffee chats
  - Helping your classmates
  - DMing me thoughts and questions to add to my lecture notes

If there's another form that works for you, or if you're anxious about how youâ€™re participating, reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we'll need to meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw.
