title: Acceptable Participation
text: You're expected to regularly, substantively participate through thoughtful, informal contributions in text channels and sync class sessions that reflect what we're learning organically reacting/replying to classmates; doing classwork in a relatively timely fashion; and attending coffee chats. Participation takes a lot of forms! These are all measurable, valid forms of participation: talking out loud; posting on Discord during and outside of classtime; reading and writing with classmates; organically replying and reacting to classmates' posts (no boring "discussion board"-style replies, please!); working with me in coffee chats; helping your classmates; DMing me thoughts and questions to add to my lecture notes; if there's another form that works for you, or if you're anxious about how youâ€™re participating, reach out to me so we can talk about it! After 5 weeks of low participation, we'll need to meet to discuss whether it makes sense for you to stay in the class or withdraw!
