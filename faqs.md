# Overview

This page will contain frequently asked questions as they're asked and answered in class, text channels, coffee chats, and elsewhere. I'll note updates to the FAQs periodically on Discord, but keep checking back, too!

## How do I schedule a coffee chat with you?

After clicking 🍵 Let's Chat! at the top right, follow the directions on Zcal to reserve an appointment. First, select the time interval you want (🕛10, 🕐15, or 🕑20 min) at the bottom left, then choose a date/time that works for you.</p>

If there are no available timeslots on a given day, it means I'm fully booked and you'll have to reserve another date/time. I tend to be fully booked around the middle and end of the semester, so make sure to book early and often!
